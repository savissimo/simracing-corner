When [4Fun Sim Racing](https://4funsimracing.com) organized their first **4Fun Grand Prix**, I was happy to join them. Being one of those whose mission is *"maybe not winning"* doesn't mean you can't "not win" in style, and so I immediately focused on the livery I'd wrap my car in.

The 4Fun Grand Prix was to be disputed with GT3 cars, which meant we were free to pick our favorite - not an easy task, each of them having their strengths and their weaknesses. After testing all of them, my choice fell on the **Porsche 911 GT3 R 2016**, since I was most consistent in the German car. It was time to go to the design table.

While apparently a nod to on of the most well-known racing liveries, the Rothmans, my design is actually filled with hidden references to my private life - and no, I'm not going to explain them all: let's just say that the width and the angle of the golden ribbon are not random. Clad in Panda Racing's traditional blue-gold-white colour scheme, this Porsche sports the 4Fun Grand Prix number plate, with my alternate racing number temporarily taking over my favourite 25 due to registration precedence. Mirrors and hood air vents offered great spots for color accents, while the usual *sagrinti nen* motto (Piedmontese for "take it easy", "don't make a fuss about it") appears on the doors. A phonetic transcription of "Porsche" reminds the viewer how they should pronounce the German make's name, while the panda stare in the front remind the viewer that they ought to be careful.

You can't go to a Grand Prix without a sponsor - not since the late Sixties, at least - and Panda Racing didn't want to miss the party. Lucky for us, we found a great partner in **Dame Damént Consulting**, one of the leading company consulting firms in Europe. Too bad it's fictional too: I'd hire such a company without a second thought, considering how "*dame damént*" roughly translates to "trust me"... Besides, while not exactly matching, their logo's colour scheme is a perfect fit for this livery. I feel they'll be with Panda Racing again in the future.
