With the most anticipated event, the Van Man Challenge, on Friday night, I paid little attention to the SRS daily series. And when Friday night came, I registered well in advance for the 9 pm race. But I was in for a surprise. 

At 8:10 pm, 50 minutes before the start of the race, there were 28 registered drivers. 

My rating is slightly above 600, yet I was ranking 23rd in the registration list. With 45 more minutes available for more people to arrive, I was doomed to be in Server 2. Which might have been *not bad news*... there was going to be a third split, and probably some good competition would be there with me. I knew people were talking about monstrosities like 1:38 in the Transit at Calabogie, and I thought I wouldn't be fighting against such times. 

I was wrong. I qualified 11th, with something like a 1:42, a lap I wasn't really proud of: I knew I had something more, but I didn't expect to be more than two seconds behind the polesitter. The start was decent and very *very* busy, with 20+ vans finding their way through the track *and the other vans*. A crash was bound to happen: at the Beak, the first slow corner of the race, people braked into people, far enough ahead of me that I could cruise through. 

However the good exit I got made me wish for more, and there I was, trying the outside of the next braking zone. Unfortunately there were two more of us doing the same, and before I knew it I was being shouldered into the grass. The brake reflex kicked in, but it was lethal in the Transit: its huge weight shifted way too much, and sent me into a spin... *towards the road*, of course. After collecting two opponents, who proceeded to collect the rest of the field in a comically slow version of Spa 2003, my hopes for the top ten were gone: a second mistake when I was back in P11 nailed my chances. The results show a sad P15 with 5 incident points, putting me in 48th position in the series standings. If enough people show up next week, I'll be the highest-ranked man in the third split. A great way to kick off the series indeed.

Why have I apparently lost control? Why am I going to strike through the field? But the real question is: why does my Transit have police lights on its roof - *and why does the police one not have them*? %}

I then turned to the 11 pm race, the daily race in 2015 GP3 cars. I like racing single seaters, so I gave that a try. Nürburgring's GP-Strecke is not my favourite track, but I knew it well enough to debut a new car there straight into qualifying. After a horrible start (which I repeated every time in the next days), I got hit by the only car behind me, who apparently forgot the Dunlop hairpin was there.
