excerpt: "From overcrowded events to the hills of NÃ¼rburg, a week full of regrets"

With the most anticipated event on Friday night, I paid little attention to the SRS daily series. And when Friday night came, I registered well in advance for the 9 pm race. But I was in for a surprise. 

At 8:10 pm, 50 minutes before the start of the race, there were 28 registered drivers. 

My rating is slightly above 600, yet I was ranking 23rd in the registration list. With 45 more minutes available for more people to arrive, I was doomed to be in Server 2. Which might have been *not bad news*... there was a third split, and probably some good competition would be there with me.
