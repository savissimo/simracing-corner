As the **Van Man Challenge** starts on [SRS](https://www.simracingsystem.com), **Panda Racing** is proud to confirm they will take part in the competition.

## The Van Man Challenge

The series, hosted by the renowned simracer and real-life driving coach **Ted Hough**, will feature six weekly 20-minute races, and will be contested in the **2005 Ford Transit**. The official calendar of the series includes fan-favourite tracks like Calabogie, Ahvenisto, the Glen and Charade; the latter will host the series finale and will feature a longer 1-hour race.

| Track | Country | Date | Time (CEST) |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| Calabogie Motorsports Park (Stadium) | Canada | July 30th, 2021 | 21:00 |
| Ahvenisto | Finland | August 6th, 2021 | 21:00 |
| Croft | Great Britain | August 13th, 2021 | 21:00 |
| Autodrom Most | Czech Republic | August 20th, 2021 | 21:00 |
| Watkins Glen International (Boot) | USA | August 27th, 2021 | 21:00 |
| Charade 2018 (8 km) | France | September 3rd, 2021 | 21:00 |

As usual, Ted asked the **Roundel Racing** community to choose the car for the series, and the polls were dominated by the 2005 Ford Transit. A commercial van is definitely a weird choice when it comes to racing, but this one is well-known by enthusiasts because of Sabine Schmitz, who famously drove the Transit around the Nürburgring Nordschleife in an iconic challenge for *Top Gear*. Schmitz, who was the first woman to ever win the 24 Hours of Nürburgring (which she did in 1996 and 1997), was nicknamed "the Queen of the Nordschleife"; she fell just short of completing a lap of the legendary Green Hell in less than ten minutes, clocking in at 10:08 in a diesel van, just a few seconds slower than Jeremy Clarkson's lap in a turbodiesel Jaguar S-type. So yeah, the Transit packs quite some racing pedigree - at least when there's an excellent driver behind its wheel.

## A new sponsor, a new livery, and a tribute

With this all-new livery, Panda Racing debuts never-seen-before colors to honour an outrageous series in the Ford Transit. Racing this van is also our tribute to the late Sabine Schmitz, who passed away earlier this year.
